# Scrabble
Scrabble game written in Haskell as part of my university assignment

# Usage
Unfortunately, you will not be able to run the game due to libraries provided by the universities which are currently unavailble. However, you can have a look at the file which in my opinion is nicely written so you can follow easily and understand the concept of the implementation.
